// The pointerEvents property in React Native determines how touch gestures interact with an element and its children. Hereâ€™s what each option does:

//     'box-none'
//         The element itself does not block touch events, but its children can receive them.
//         Useful when the parent is just a wrapper and shouldn't interfere with interactions on its children.

//     'none'
//         Neither the element nor its children receive touch events.
//         The entire subtree becomes non-interactive, allowing touches to pass through to elements below.

//     'box-only'
//         The element itself receives touch events, but its children do not.
//         Useful for cases where you want the parent to handle gestures (e.g., a modal background that dismisses on tap) but not its children.

//     'auto'
//         The default behavior.
//         Both the element and its children receive touch events normally.

//     undefined
//         Same as 'auto', meaning it behaves as if pointerEvents were not set.
